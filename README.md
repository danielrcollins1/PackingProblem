# PackingProblem #

A demonstration that higher D&D hit values are effectively devalued (and same for any classic RPG or wargame). 

While low-hit targets are wasting more of the attacker's overkill hits and damage, high-hit targets are suffering full damage, effectively eroding the value of their manifestly high hit points.

CompareHD1 is a randomized Monte-Carlo simulation of the effect.

CompareHD2 is an exact calculation by mathematical formula of the effect.

Both show approximately the same numbers (duplicate work done as double-check).
